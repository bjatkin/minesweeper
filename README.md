# TODO
    - make transitions from game to world map a little less jerky (add a few frames of black? or maybe a wipe?)
        * add a transition function to the scean interface (this transition will basically just be a black screen counter)
          only when transition returns true do we move into the update loop

    - add code to convert pixel images into level map layouts (64 x 64 max probably)
    - make levels with the count down timer possible
    - refactor/ clean up the code so it's easier to work with
    - add a full screen mode
    - add a save game functionality

    - cat / tidal wave power ups are not getting re-uped after rechargeing?? (maybe)
    - shuffel seems to still be a little bit buggy??
    - Add a continue button to the pause menu (the play pause buttons in the corner are too small)
