# TODO
    - make transitions from game to work map a little less jerky (add a few frames of black? or maybe a wipe?)
    - add code to convert pixel images into level map layouts (64 x 64 max probably)
    - make levels with the count down timer possible
    - refactor/ clean up the code so it's easier to work with
    - add a full screen mode
