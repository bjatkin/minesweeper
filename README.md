# Minesweeper: Ready Set Duck

This is a simple minesweeper clone build using go and the [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/)
The code is really messy and needs a solid refactor but I've moved on to bigger and better things.
Perhaps I'll come back to this at some future data, for now you can play it on [itch.io](https://aanval.itch.io/mine-sweeper)

# Building

you can build the code for the web, mac, and windows by simpley running the `build` script in this repo.
It will attempt to build for all platforms, so you may see errors if you don't have dependencides installed for other platforms.
